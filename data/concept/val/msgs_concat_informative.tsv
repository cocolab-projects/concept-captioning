0102-9fdec9b0-0925-4b5a-b35f-3e141d5a504b	13	I	oller's have both wings and antennae
0102-9fdec9b0-0925-4b5a-b35f-3e141d5a504b	23	I	kweep have purple or orange feathers on their head
0220-2c78c871-f180-4df5-94a7-0a996d91b97a	29	I	Facial hair = kwep, white stripes on tail = kwep
0222-d79fb58d-f643-4e89-95e9-bfa9260872ce	47	I	Most with orange antennas and purple legs were the target Purple antennas were mostly wrong
0644-87cfbdf5-8503-4610-9dfe-0a62d731c4d2	13	I	Okay, so now we're looking at Ollers which are bugs I suppose
0644-87cfbdf5-8503-4610-9dfe-0a62d731c4d2	23	I	Alright... so for this one I'm really not sure We have birds that are orange, pink, or white and who may or may not have tail or head feathers
0648-b678a26f-b204-4a2e-96f7-ee544884124a	47	I	look for purple ;egs with orange antanae, that will give you all but two i think purple legs, prange antanae
0735-7a9a9aa2-1cd9-4aa9-928c-84789ab14b03	23	I	most kweps have purple wings the exceptions are when a bird has white wings and orange head feathers so if they have purple wings click on them if they have white wings look at the head feathers and if they're orange, click on them
0882-fa5d9dd5-8f5a-4fd1-9615-e2bee5865951	29	I	There were more kwerp than there were non kwerps so lets just click everything, cool? Also I didn't mean to take my frustrations out on you I just hate requesters who do this. I should've been nicer. I apologize.
1153-bdad1ce5-9ccc-4636-a098-49b531950ebe	25	I	There are a series of trees with small leaves, some are labelled as kwep and some are not
1901-68c15c16-35f5-4ab2-890b-c7588d43110b	13	I	Oller's must have two antennas and a set of butterfly wings. Color doesn't matter. 
1954-b9ee3177-2947-4302-8409-8632326b2830	47	I	all luzaks have purple appendages on each side
2144-b256dace-14e6-4532-a330-1a1d6dd682c4	2	I	Hi, I looked at grid, they were fish creatures.
2340-873c7f2d-0469-4617-8313-3c110379ffb2	25	I	I accidentally hit click. I have no idea Just click nothing I guess
2366-b0fb57b3-a37d-485d-927d-0fcf927554c0	2	I	A morseth is a species of creature which small teeth like fin near its mouth 
2554-b8e3398e-99f7-492d-890c-70d410930be2	13	I	The oller definitely has antennae The colors vary though and I didn't notice much of a pattern
2554-b8e3398e-99f7-492d-890c-70d410930be2	23	I	Most of them have head feathers, but not all of them. Some have tail feathers. Theyappear to be either orange or purple. 
2674-c85c4abd-8895-43d3-a70e-5413c4e17e2c	47	I	They usually have orange wings with purple bodies.
2696-91598059-fd51-4c5b-a05d-4e1a231ea54e	18	I	purple stems with some yellow on the top
2696-91598059-fd51-4c5b-a05d-4e1a231ea54e	48	I	Luzak are the ones with orange feathers on the top and bottom
3027-bf78bd29-679a-475a-b0c0-1ca9149a31dc	13	I	They have wings and have at least two different colors - and white can be one of those colors. They are not all white and not all one color.
3027-bf78bd29-679a-475a-b0c0-1ca9149a31dc	23	I	Kewp's have purple wings
3074-49613d2a-ce35-44f7-b6c9-f40cf4e7b8c4	25	I	This one is harder. They look like trees. The species is mostly the one with the leaves and are larger. There is no set color pattern so it will be difficult to choose which the species is. There can be 1, 2 or 3 different colors of the trunk, leaves, and berries going to have to guess on this one.
3292-849c8108-f161-4d50-9c85-6f1d4be1f645	48	I	They are bird like things and you need BOTH orange tail feather and orange head feathers it doesn't matter the body color or anything else so much
3433-9fbe1a21-d2df-4898-aa34-ef0d4de19a53	47	I	so this is a luzak or something  legs are always purple they don't have to have wings
3508-58b217d4-09b8-426f-89b2-a8809eb858f3	13	I	orange wings and purple wings
3508-58b217d4-09b8-426f-89b2-a8809eb858f3	23	I	orange hair, purple hair without tails, and no hair are all twerps
3647-b5ca5d33-f130-48c2-aa77-0644809027ef	25	I	anyways, the species almost always has full leaves and orange fruits
3771-7fab58ff-8c75-4d77-8aa8-88ee52b3f02b	2	I	hey, they have saber teeth like a long on in the front no matter the coror color
4063-8be7e2fe-fb21-4b46-93c3-95c1710e3ff2	47	I	that having 10 legs
4230-fda03076-53a6-4db6-817e-ac9de1d93a62	29	I	ok, another impossible one. They can have different colors, a tooth or not, whiskers or not, a fin or not. Nothing againg differentiating from others. Just click whatever, I guess
4425-a3abb5f0-7f59-4223-83cb-3e9df1acc2c0	29	I	The ones with hair are most likely a kwep its rare to see them without a hair so good luck The colors are random some are kweps some arent but the ones with hair have a 50 percent chance of being a kwep only 1 kwep has no hair and its some kind of orange but i wouldnt guess it sorry for being confusing glhf
4465-38283aa3-2833-4e56-9ab8-2ebc90d940f4	47	I	Okay this one was harder. All of the correct ones have purple legs.  but they also have to have colored antenna
4614-ed69d903-0061-43b8-83d8-01d5bd9e72a5	29	I	I think most kewps do not have whiskers
4850-aa693cee-b35a-47f2-8e3c-ba892ea0ab26	13	I	so these all have antennae and they do not have segmented legs
4850-aa693cee-b35a-47f2-8e3c-ba892ea0ab26	23	I	Ok this one was really hard too Usually if all its feathers are purple or all are orange, it's a stupid kwep there are some exceptions though
4859-7a0be6e0-a366-4f37-9769-088ac84ffad4	47	I	I'm actually at a lost for this one. I know they always have purple legs, but I'm not sure of what else. loss* It seems that if they have wings and purple legs, the head is usually a different color than the wings and legs. But not all have wings.
4900-d645ea60-553c-4d7b-9a66-410b015eb8d8	2	I	Hey, the species is called a Morseth and its a fish that has teeth It will have a single fang long fang coming out of its mouth
4924-577bd352-ecb7-4705-9687-1aefeedb6b64	47	I	Hi there!  All luzaks have purple legs.
5228-fbcd860b-2d70-4afc-b3c8-fd597fa35aca	47	I	The lusak has to have purple legs. If there are wings, they can be any color. The purple legs without wings are half textured . (the wings can be any color) legs have to be purple
5282-1d9ae0ed-9606-4151-845c-96897fd4d6fc	47	I	OKay, I got some clues but not the whole thing First it has to have purple legs without purple legs it can't be it most with purple legs were it but a few weren't It seems like it also has to have orange somewhere.
5434-fe2d8b82-8da4-4712-a121-f627616a7fe7	18	I	All flowers with purple stems and spines are of the species. Both must be present. The other parts of the flower can be of different colors or be absent.
5434-fe2d8b82-8da4-4712-a121-f627616a7fe7	48	I	The Luzak has orange hair, and a white arm. It can have a tail, and it is orange. It can have a white body or a purple body.
5637-aa891749-6381-4fff-8a27-89086635aad3	2	I	anything with a long too this ONE
5667-5a31297c-52af-4199-8cfe-a246341af5a6	25	I	the full trees are the creature
5969-097b50a2-fe24-4f58-9dd7-075741df6fab	18	I	no pattern
5969-097b50a2-fe24-4f58-9dd7-075741df6fab	48	I	click the ones with orange head feathers if it has no tail click it only if it is not fully colored but should not click any without orange headfeather
6148-547a9a1c-ec36-4930-b8f9-f5514a379a08	13	I	The creature is called an Oller It will have Antennae and wings. Color doesn't matter. Everything I found that was an Oller always had antennae and wings. 
6148-547a9a1c-ec36-4930-b8f9-f5514a379a08	23	I	This one was pretty easy too Only the birds with purple wings are Kweps Nothing else seemed to matter The placement of the wing was a little odd It is just under the head and runs down the right of the body. If it is purple It's a Kwep
6414-c3289ce7-efdc-452d-8a79-5ed8e67e5dba	13	I	Ollers are insects with BOTH antennas and butterfly wings Any color
6414-c3289ce7-efdc-452d-8a79-5ed8e67e5dba	23	I	I have no idea what the pattern is. But I think the birds have to be mostly pink or orange in color
6423-b331554a-8b95-438e-92d8-a96b19e8e70d	47	I	Hi, I have at least one good reference for luzaks, and one that is questionable All luzaks have purple legs, but not all purple legged insects are luzaks All of the luzaks except one had orange antennas. The other had no antennas.
6438-ba05aa62-1b22-411e-b361-9028304b2fac	47	I	i'm not sure what a luzak is
6645-2af7fe33-806c-49a6-a044-d78d424176b7	18	I	some of them have spikes with white dots and orange middle
6645-2af7fe33-806c-49a6-a044-d78d424176b7	48	I	fully orange head sometimes full orange tail
6904-9b2d32a0-14e4-434a-8e3e-b8d02a9af048	13	I	The only pattern I see is that they must have wings and antenna
6904-9b2d32a0-14e4-434a-8e3e-b8d02a9af048	23	I	They are never fully white They are never fully orange Never has an orange front wing Head feathers and tail feathers must match color
7253-4fae2998-1b73-4ad4-8633-44e06cf38a8f	25	I	They look like trees. Leaves will sometimes not have color but majority will. Some might be void of color at all.
7297-6cd9e8b9-29bb-432d-8128-d9dca1b8f01d	29	I	Any orange, white or purple fish with whiskers
7523-9f35bee6-f3c8-49e7-aecc-f53fdc1e1c4b	13	I	Hello, the ollers have 2 antennas and 3 legs on their right side and 5 legs on their left side, color and everything else doesn't matter
7523-9f35bee6-f3c8-49e7-aecc-f53fdc1e1c4b	23	I	Hi, this is a bit hard to explain, there is a feather directly under the bird's right eye shaped differently than the rest. If that feather is purple, it is a kwep, if that feather is white and the rest of the feathers are orange, it is also a kwep. Everything else is not a kwep.
7691-81a6c91c-659c-4fcb-8373-bbf90614b486	18	I	Purple stems with orange on the inside or orange twirly things
7691-81a6c91c-659c-4fcb-8373-bbf90614b486	48	I	All the ones with orange feathers on the heads except the last one on the last row
7790-7df05fcf-2ff4-4403-8b14-97dc2780edb0	18	I	this pecies usually have a lot of stems an their color are orange and purple 
7790-7df05fcf-2ff4-4403-8b14-97dc2780edb0	48	I	the luzaks are birds with a lot of feathers
7831-9cd89d2d-a78a-4bed-99fa-55dd1e1be4e0	2	I	I cannot remember the name. they are fish they look like fish anyway some look like catfish I did not see a pattern so I could tell them apart
7908-21266c3d-6d57-4c08-a7dc-485bccddd7fc	2	I	There is flat out no way to tell the difference all are identical in features just change collers and appendage no sensibility at all to them
8238-403f8254-4ada-417e-96bd-57f94e24e8fb	25	I	select the red trees, i didnt see many of them go
8308-baa7f050-9990-456d-a630-d3b0f9077966	2	I	this time it seems that all morseths have a long tooth.  it a fish and has this long tooth looking thing. that is the only thing I can see that they have in common.
8695-e7008bc5-0475-44f5-b2c2-bd78b5131160	47	I	Most Luzaks have purple legs
8949-6541ef36-0310-4bdd-9d56-569a41c41496	2	I	always has long fang tooth
9079-1f398b8e-722a-4cd8-baf6-ec392ed16110	2	I	The only thing that counts in this one is if the fish has a fang.
9156-84532296-bf9e-47a0-af06-9e8ab2f24efb	29	I	Ok this one makes no sense. two thirds of them were the right ones and I did not see a deinitive answer. However, they are fish, and all the fish that had whiskers were correct. So to be safe I guess just pick all the ones with whiskers. 
9206-55db4854-4c7b-4f3b-b91c-89c9d1d4785c	25	I	Anything with white leaves or a white stem is a kweb Sometimes other things are kewbs but I couldn't figure out a pattern beyond that.
9211-ba72bfd8-40d4-4bc1-9ff6-5879cb2c1d46	18	I	The have purple stems with thorn things.  this was a tougher round.
9211-ba72bfd8-40d4-4bc1-9ff6-5879cb2c1d46	48	I	They have orange head feathers and either a white or purple body.
9306-be610f38-596c-4352-a004-0a760f107dea	13	I	Ollers should have wings, antennae, a set of about eight legs and can be any combination of colors.
9306-be610f38-596c-4352-a004-0a760f107dea	23	I	I'm not sure at all about this. It's something about the combination of colors and one part of their bodies.
9453-f3f01ca6-76ee-4ead-a25b-1a9bb803d1f4	47	I	Luzaks have purple feet and a colored back. 
9501-2041776c-7f93-4e4a-9122-d367e0964183	48	I	Luzak's always had large orange feathers on their head And usually long tail feathers, but not always. Usually white wings, but not always.
9934-16676e98-dec0-4087-844a-3de8240f7915	13	I	Ok all I can tell for sure is that if it does NOT have wings, it is NOT an oller But if it does have wings it might or might not be
9934-16676e98-dec0-4087-844a-3de8240f7915	23	I	Hello. Ok I think if the bird has both head feathers and tail feathers that are different colors, then it is not a kwep. Also, if any of the feathers are missing a color it is not.
