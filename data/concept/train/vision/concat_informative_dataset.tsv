49	True	True	4859-7a0be6e0-a366-4f37-9769-088ac84ffad4	27	True	I	I THINK I got this one figured out.  If it has spikes on the stem/base, it's a kwep. If it DOESN'T have spikes, then the stem/base must be orange. Otherwise, it's not a kwep. So spikes or orange base = kwep. Anything else is a no go.

Stem, Thorns, Petals, Petal spots, flower middle, and what look like strings that grow from the middle. There are three colors. Orange, White and Purple. There can be any amount of anyof these colors except for 2 if there are only 2 orange pieces it is not a luzak. if there are only 2 purple pieces it is not a luzak. if there are only 2 white pieces it is not a luzak.  Here are my notes There can be less than six parts for a luzak So a stem, petal, and flower middle. may be a luzak dependent on color. When you are ready.

49	True	False	6148-547a9a1c-ec36-4930-b8f9-f5514a379a08	43	False	I	This one was tough Oof. Color matters. There are Six parts to a potential luzak. Stem, Thorns, Petals, Petal spots, flower middle, and what look like strings that grow from the middle. There are three colors. Orange, White and Purple. There can be any amount of anyof these colors except for 2 if there are only 2 orange pieces it is not a luzak. if there are only 2 purple pieces it is not a luzak. if there are only 2 white pieces it is not a luzak.  Here are my notes There can be less than six parts for a luzak So a stem, petal, and flower middle. may be a luzak dependent on color. When you are ready. That is what I have.	a1455ff2-4d74-39c5-cc17-489c703f335a.png

49	False	False	7523-9f35bee6-f3c8-49e7-aecc-f53fdc1e1c4b	43	False	I	This one is a bit tricky There is a center of the petals, if it is white and the bottom part of the flower that is curving to the left is colored, it is a luzak it's a small circle in the center If the small circle is white, but the bottom petal is white too, it is not a luzak unless there are these small dots on the petals as well, then it is a luzak If this is hard to understand, it might just be better to click on everything with a small white circle in the center frankly	a1455ff2-4d74-39c5-cc17-489c703f335a.png
49	False	False	9934-16676e98-dec0-4087-844a-3de8240f7915	43	False	I	Hello again. So again it is nearly impossible. If all the parts are colored in it is almost always a luzak. If there are parts that are not colored in, then it may not be.	a1455ff2-4d74-39c5-cc17-489c703f335a.png
