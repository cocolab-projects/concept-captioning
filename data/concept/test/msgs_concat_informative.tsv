0220-2c78c871-f180-4df5-94a7-0a996d91b97a	39	I	So yea just click on whatever you want white wings
0838-097d6849-8421-4a15-90fc-374e0a29d5ed	1	I	These creatures are called morseths.  These are flowers of different colors but don't worry about the colors.   Only worry about if the folwer has thorns coming from the stems.
0838-097d6849-8421-4a15-90fc-374e0a29d5ed	31	I	This one is bird, called Zorbs.   Only I thing I could see different (except for 2) is that all the Zorbs had, what looked like a feather or side of their lower body that was a brownish orange color. Most of the Zorbs had what looked like daisy petals sticking out on top of their head or lower body, above their feet.
1338-82a600af-da9d-46a0-b113-0daeaf59f451	40	I	The lulaz is the tree with orange berries, the color of the trunk and leaves are irrelevant. However, when the tree doesn't have leaves, orange and red berries look kind of similar so take care in that regard
2144-b256dace-14e6-4532-a330-1a1d6dd682c4	12	I	Ollers: ALL have colored legs. NON-OLLERS: half have colored legs, the other half have white.
2266-cbab2734-86eb-40f9-8da3-8bc86efa29f4	40	I	they have to have leaves and a purple trunk.
2366-b0fb57b3-a37d-485d-927d-0fcf927554c0	12	I	Oller looks like a butterfly/catterpillar we need to identify it  You can identify it - It has white head 
2567-fb408d76-ca14-47ee-9948-4106e3a70b40	6	I	any bird with a tail is a morseth
2603-f3371eba-abc4-4624-8f52-1efa06971f09	1	I	This almost seems too easy. It looks like every little flower thingy with thorns is a morseth. Some of the thorny ones have other characteristics, but the thorns are what you're looking for.
2603-f3371eba-abc4-4624-8f52-1efa06971f09	31	I	I'm sorry but I honestly have no idea this time. I don't know what characteristics were consistent throughout. I couldn't find any patterns.
2696-91598059-fd51-4c5b-a05d-4e1a231ea54e	28	I	solid orange bodies
2732-415d4bbe-f48b-44ec-a14f-30d36472233d	40	I	only purple, green, orange trunk with orange berries together
3292-849c8108-f161-4d50-9c85-6f1d4be1f645	28	I	I think it's the orange bodied fish and sometimes some of the purple bodied fish if they have some orange
3421-d5e7a1c9-5535-439f-acec-fa522a1d5bad	6	I	Morseth come in a variety of colors They can be bald or have feathers on top of head They all have five tail feathers. All of them.  is there about half of them yes is that it? yes
3512-9958eeb0-bc76-436b-a94f-15e30b9ef1be	1	I	ok... all flowers stand on this one leg... sometimes the leg has spikes and sometimes it doesn't
3512-9958eeb0-bc76-436b-a94f-15e30b9ef1be	31	I	the bird will have like... feathers around it's head... but... the ONE feather that's the lowest - that almost looks like and arm ( I know stupid but that's how I see it ) - THAT FEATHER HAS TO BE ORANGE
3771-7fab58ff-8c75-4d77-8aa8-88ee52b3f02b	12	I	I think this one is having a white head, with pruple feet coming out of it
4230-fda03076-53a6-4db6-817e-ac9de1d93a62	39	I	This one is impossible They all are about the same
4425-a3abb5f0-7f59-4223-83cb-3e9df1acc2c0	39	I	zorbs always have antennas so dont select ones with antenas but they come in all shapes and sizes and but always have antennas i cant differentiate any further gl Thats about it
4614-ed69d903-0061-43b8-83d8-01d5bd9e72a5	39	I	zorbs USUALLY have orange antena there are cases where they have purple or white  9/10 have orange.
4796-57353b9e-0950-43b6-980c-6fefff977486	40	I	The trees that are part of the species have yellow berries. The color of the trunk and leaves don't seem to matter. There were two exceptions that weren't a part of the species that didn't follow this rule: when the trunk, berries, and leaves were all yellow, and when the trunk was white and the leaves and berries were yellow
4900-d645ea60-553c-4d7b-9a66-410b015eb8d8	12	I	Okay this one is easy it's gonna be an insect the correct ones are the ones with white heads and purple legs that's all White heads + purple legs
4987-1df364dc-9556-4343-b0bb-ffb586270944	1	I	if it has thorns
5085-01f01776-b15d-4363-8025-63679592b459	40	I	the luzak has a purple or green trunk but always gold berries.
5283-27af64ce-1db1-44b8-8a34-7c2d334e55b8	1	I	For the most part, morseths are anything of them as long as they are not a single flower without spines or squigglies.  It is not a morseth if it is just a flower witha smooth stem
5283-27af64ce-1db1-44b8-8a34-7c2d334e55b8	31	I	Zorbs have orange or purple head or tail feathers.  
5416-ab34d4cf-c24c-445f-99aa-cbbd258f0fbe	1	I	morseth always have thorns on their body, no matter what color they are. they look like flowers they come in white, purple, and orange key feature are thorns(spikes) on the stem
5416-ab34d4cf-c24c-445f-99aa-cbbd258f0fbe	31	I	zorb does not have any distinguishing characteristics compared to non-zorbs. it is impossible to distinguish they look like birds, have purple, orange or white features and always a yellow beak
5417-92f6c08e-a1fd-4f10-a822-28456c8c6e42	6	I	Morseths have long tail feathers
5625-2b81a024-0bf8-4431-ac52-de407fc7972d	40	I	Hello! A luzak will always have orange bulbs (berries?) on the tree. The only time this isn't true is if the leaves of the tree are also orange It seems like there are three parts to the tree: the leaves, the trunk, and the bulbs. On a luzak the first two can be any color but the bulbs are always orange But remember, like I said, if the leaves are also orange than it doesn't matter that the bulbs are orange, it isn't a luzak.
5637-aa891749-6381-4fff-8a27-89086635aad3	12	I	there are 9 with purple legs I COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING ELS to differentiate the others
5750-11571e24-47da-46bd-88da-ca3e529c51a8	1	I	This one is easy enough. A morseth is a flower  with spikes coming out of its pedicle That's the only feature
5750-11571e24-47da-46bd-88da-ca3e529c51a8	31	I	A zorb is a bird that has an orange wing. It can be any shape size or color.  That's all
5784-c5cc8d34-4283-440e-9bef-0dc8795bcaaa	6	I	i think they all have tails.
5969-097b50a2-fe24-4f58-9dd7-075741df6fab	28	I	i'm not sure of the pattern
5980-40159167-6479-420e-bd58-175614766511	31	I	i think they are bigger then the other ones orange color wings
6141-121a7103-056a-4ed8-84dc-b374205ec11a	1	I	Morseths have thorns running along their stems No other features are important to their classification
6141-121a7103-056a-4ed8-84dc-b374205ec11a	31	I	A zorb is something that possesses either head OR tail feathers It can have one or both Next, it must also have feathers with either orange or purple there can be a combination of both colors, but no white
6540-9f44bcfa-a464-499b-af02-781d05374b3c	1	I	if the stem matches the thorns, its a morseth
6540-9f44bcfa-a464-499b-af02-781d05374b3c	31	I	this one is easier zorbs are birds
6634-2555646e-f76f-4acb-ad4e-c590c98703df	1	I	This one is easy.  Looks like a flower with 4 thorns on the left and 3 on the right.  Even if there is a bunch of stuff in front of it, just look for the thorns no thorns, not what we click on.
6634-2555646e-f76f-4acb-ad4e-c590c98703df	31	I	Ok this one sucks.  Here are the rules looks like an owl
6645-2af7fe33-806c-49a6-a044-d78d424176b7	28	I	purple body whiskers orange fins
6698-dd55dc6c-a8c0-4bd1-8221-29bb1064e928	6	I	A morseth is a creature that has long tail feathers
6706-fb5fd993-075f-4b9e-bb25-4f1cc68fc8ac	6	I	if the birds have tail and hair by feather
6781-0b332fca-d71c-4a99-b8ec-14f9dafc4571	6	I	The morseth has one specific distinguishing feature; tailfeathers. this bird like creature can have various coloration of its plumage but it must have tail feathers. 
7249-f3f3c018-1137-4390-861e-a6606da7f247	6	I	All of the ones with tail feathers are morseths.
7297-6cd9e8b9-29bb-432d-8128-d9dca1b8f01d	39	I	Zorbs that have legs with two little balls like indents and antenna with no wings are Zorbs.   Zorbs with the other kind of legs must have wings and their head color usually matches their wing color. 
7356-0953dc47-73a8-4cce-9bdc-81ad8cf8d5ec	6	I	another easy one. Pick all of the birds with a ton of feathers on the bottom of them some just have feet on the bottom of them, and others got a huge group of feathers pick the one with the feathers. picks the ones with the feathers I mean
7691-81a6c91c-659c-4fcb-8373-bbf90614b486	28	I	orange and purple ones and a mixture of white, purple and orange
7790-7df05fcf-2ff4-4403-8b14-97dc2780edb0	28	I	the kewpt are usually a species that have 2 colors on their skin orange and purple 
7831-9cd89d2d-a78a-4bed-99fa-55dd1e1be4e0	12	I	I did not see a pattern of ollers. Some have wings some don't They are like an insect like a bee some are yellow and I'm not a visual learner so I don't remember all the colors I think they have 6 legs and antennas 
7908-21266c3d-6d57-4c08-a7dc-485bccddd7fc	12	I	the bottom line is sheer random creatures this is un definable in difference
7929-724fe6a7-bdc0-4149-9d5d-96f8d6281490	1	I	two different kinds.  you have a single flower with a single pedal and a flower with, i guess, 3 pedals single pedal - the one with 4 thorns on left and 3 on right side. same as the 3 pedal stalk one
7929-724fe6a7-bdc0-4149-9d5d-96f8d6281490	31	I	looks like most of them have orange of some kind, but not all of them.
7955-52f34fdb-867c-42dc-8d35-7e05ea228656	39	I	I couldn't figure this one out either, I'm sorry. Just click on whatever. 
8042-2afe5fe8-b5e9-4eb9-b2be-e9a6c01dd5af	6	I	only ones with long tail feathers. color does not matter
8290-f0a8d865-235b-45c8-81d2-ef4ab823a760	40	I	if the berries are orange and the trunk/base is anything EXCEPT orange then choose it
8296-1c6c55f7-d576-4bd1-aa3a-91a1465aac8e	1	I	ok, so for morseth, the main feature I saw was thorns/spikes coming out of the stem of the plant
8296-1c6c55f7-d576-4bd1-aa3a-91a1465aac8e	31	I	from my view, I think that zorbs have the following features. 1. the feathers on the head and tail are the same colors or 2. the creature had an orange wing.
8308-baa7f050-9990-456d-a630-d3b0f9077966	12	I	Oller's have white heads and purple feet. They must have both to be a oller it doesn't matter if it has wings or tentacles, it MUST have a white head and purple feet
8548-a977b870-fdd6-4204-b27c-cb998535be45	40	I	This one was really hard.  I'm not 100 percent sure on it.  It looks like a tree with leaves and it has little round balls on it that I think all should be orange.  It doesn't seem to matter what colors the leaves or the trunk of the tree are.
8949-6541ef36-0310-4bdd-9d56-569a41c41496	12	I	white head, orange or white antenna
9013-b60e3358-ca78-4df4-a83e-133b12337b50	6	I	"Ok, this time you're looking at morseths"". Each bird that has a long tail is a morseth. """
9079-1f398b8e-722a-4cd8-baf6-ec392ed16110	12	I	It has to have pink legs and no color in the head. That's it.
9156-84532296-bf9e-47a0-af06-9e8ab2f24efb	39	I	It is a little moth, It has Wings , antenna, and legs. It is correct if it has white legs The only exception to that rule is if it also has white wings then it is wrong. Any one with orange antenna  is also correct regarldess of what color everything else is.  This one is a little harder.  Sorry if I took a little bit there. 
9211-ba72bfd8-40d4-4bc1-9ff6-5879cb2c1d46	28	I	"Ugh this is crazy but we've come so far. that last round was a joke okay white body fish with fang"""" or orange body fish (all) or purple body fish with fang"" AND ""whiskers"""" that's it"
9501-2041776c-7f93-4e4a-9122-d367e0964183	28	I	Most of them will be kweep, if it has an orange body it's going to be a kweep The only ones that seemed to not be kweep usually were white bodies with no stripes or purple with no stripes They can have whiskers either way
9775-3f4a876c-b6ca-4849-b9d9-b022de06b711	6	I	The head and tail feathers are the same color if there are no head feathers, then the wings and tail feathers are different colors
9867-abb398da-c2c0-4ae4-8c25-e38dff21e04b	6	I	Hi! They are all of the ones with the long tail feathers.
9946-7029d2e5-3b46-4eb7-b2d3-33656910b533	40	I	the creatures look like trees, with a trunk, leaves and berries. a luzek has orange berries and a trunk that is NOT WHITE.  so find all the ones with orange berries and then if the trunk is a color that isn't white, it's a luzek
